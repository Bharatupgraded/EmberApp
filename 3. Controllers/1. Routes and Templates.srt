[MUSIC]

00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:06,921
Let's add some interactivity to our app
and

3
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:12,010
work on a feature where you can click a
button to trigger a pop-up.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,670
As a reminder, we've been working with
templates,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,150
which define how our application looks.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,290
Now, we'll start working with controllers,
which define how our application behaves.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,505
We'll start off by writing some HTML in
our template.

8
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:30,800
[SOUND] In Ember, if we want some kind of
action to be

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,484
triggered by clicking an element, such as
opening a pop-up,

10
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:41,536
we use the action handlebars helper.

11
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:47,510
Now, we define the action in the
controller associated with this root.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,660
Let's make a new file called
controllers/about.js.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,380
And in it we'll write our controller.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,245
We define controllers as properties on our
main ember application.

15
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:06,380
Blogger.AboutController.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,750
They follow a naming convention in which
the controller name must be

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,790
the capitalized version of the route name
with Controller added to the end.

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,557
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:27,810
Ember.Controller.extend creates a sub
class of the Ember.Controller class.

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,070
You get all the default behavior of an
Ember Controller plus any

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,680
additional behaviors you define.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:41,322
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:44,789
Here, we're defining the showRealName
action,

24
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,130
which is going to pop up our alert.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,690
Let's check out the results of our work in
the browser.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,340
Here we have the error, nothing handled
the action showRealName.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,930
That means that, somehow, we didn't define
our action properly.

28
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,190
Let's take a look at our code again.

29
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,860
Well, here's our action defined on our
controller.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,890
It's the same as this action.

31
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,475
What we forgot to do was to add our
controller to our

32
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:24,210
index.html in the JavaScript script tag.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,360
Now if we refresh our page, there we go.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,263
It works.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:33,911
Let's add an action to the contact page,
that lets users submit a secret message.

36
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:43,911
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,611
And then we'll create a controller to
handle the action.

38
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,777
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:06,566
[NOISE] For now, we won't actually

40
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:12,354
do anything with the message since

41
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:18,341
we don't really have like a backend

42
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:23,940
server or anything to handle it.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,634
Okay.

44
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,586
And then let's not forget to add this
index.html.

45
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:36,174
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,586
And then let's take a look on our page.

47
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:45,160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,270
Okay, there we go.

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,490
Now you know how to define actions and
ember controllers.
