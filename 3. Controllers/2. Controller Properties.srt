1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,940
Popping up messages is all well and

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,310
good, but the real power of Ember is in
creating rich user interfaces.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,390
As a step in this direction, let's add
actions that show and

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,055
hide a picture of Dracula on the About
page, like this.

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:19,077
[SOUND] We'll start by defining a property
on the controller.

6
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:26,857
[SOUND] Then in our template we can use
this property.

7
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,235
[SOUND] So

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:37,049
if the picture is showing,

9
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:43,844
that property is true,

10
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:52,355
then we'll show that image.

11
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:54,682
Otherwise, we'll show a button.

12
00:00:54,682 --> 00:01:03,900
[SOUND] And that button will have an
action to show the picture.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,634
[SOUND] Since, isPictureShowing,

14
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:17,147
is set to false in the controller.

15
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:25,362
[SOUND] The else branch in the template
will be shown.

16
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:28,700
Now, let's make our show picture action.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,103
And make it so it will change the property
to true.

18
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:34,866
[SOUND] Changing a property on

19
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:41,294
a controller is as simple as running
this.set,

20
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:45,997
the property's name as a string and

21
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:53,391
then the new value that you'd like the
property set to.

22
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:59,173
It's important in Ember never to access
properties directly on an object

23
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:04,980
such as by writing something like
this.isPictureShowing equals true.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,100
Don't do that.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,070
Embers ability to observe changes and
automatically update them throughout your

26
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,727
application depends on using the .set
method.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,410
Now if we go to our browser.

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,980
We can refresh the page.

29
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,860
Go to about.

30
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,090
Once again, we have that error.

31
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,990
Nothing hindered the action, show picture.

32
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,100
Let's see what we did wrong.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,560
Notice this other error up here,
unexpected token in about js line ten.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,460
It means I made a syntax error.

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,273
Sure enough, we can see I opened this
curly brace but I didn't close it.

36
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:51,092
[SOUND] If I add that closing curly brace
[SOUND] and refresh.

37
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:54,610
Now, let's look at the picture.

38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,130
There we go.

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,950
What a scary guy.

40
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,610
This approach to updating the page is one
of the fundamental differences between

41
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,470
building a user interface in Ember and
using something like jQuery.

42
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,540
With jQuery you describe the steps needed
to

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,090
take the user interface from one state to
another.

44
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,220
To build this feature, we'd need to say to
show one of the elements of the dom, and

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,010
to hide another.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,430
With Ember, you describe how your user
interface should look in various states.

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,780
And let Ember take care of making the user
interface look that way.

48
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,927
Let's add another button to the page to
hide the photo.

49
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:45,927
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:54,774
And then in our controller we'll define
this hide picture action.

51
00:03:54,774 --> 00:04:04,774
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:11,979
And when we refresh our page, we can see
the photo and we can hide it.

53
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:17,229
[SOUND] Let's add a similar feature in our
contact page.

54
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:23,952
[SOUND] If the message has already

55
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:30,677
been sent we'll say thank you.

56
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:35,480
Your message has been sent.

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,989
If the message hasn't been sent.

58
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:40,584
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,900
Then we'll give them the option to send
the message.

60
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,428
In our contact controller we'll make a
property for

61
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:54,120
messageSent, set it to false by default.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,720
And then once the message gets sent, we'll
switch the messageSent property to true.

63
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,001
[SOUND] And then let's take a look.

64
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,019
Make sure that works.

65
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:13,856
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,040
There we go.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,530
Sure enough.

68
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,550
Let's take this a step further and

69
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,060
print out a random confirmation number
after the message gets sent.

70
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,930
First go back to our template.

71
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,333
And we'll add-

72
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:34,173
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:38,020
Now we need to set that confirmation
number in a controller action.

74
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,470
And we'll put it right here.

75
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,274
[BLANK_AUDIO]

76
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:47,060
And we'll make it equal to a random
number.

77
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,590
Here you can see that a controller
property can actually get displayed on

78
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,760
the page.

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,470
Setting or updating it is as easy as using
this .set.

80
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,010
Just like with any other controller
property.

81
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,810
In a real app, of course, the confirmation
number would

82
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,250
probably be returned from a server where
the message was sent to.

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,750
We'll learn more about working with
servers when we start working with models.

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,754
For now, let's check out our feature.

85
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:18,256
[BLANK_AUDIO]

86
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,820
There's our confirmation number.

87
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,900
That just about wraps it up for
controllers.

88
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,090
To recap, the job of a controller is to
handle the display logic of

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,530
your application.

90
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,280
It provides two tools to help out with
this.

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,528
[SOUND] Properties, and actions.

92
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,615
Actions define some sort of behavior such
as opening a pop-up or

93
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,040
changing a property.

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,912
[SOUND] Properties can be displayed
directly on the page.

95
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:47,163
Or it can be used to determine
conditionals about what part of

96
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:48,640
the template is rendered.
