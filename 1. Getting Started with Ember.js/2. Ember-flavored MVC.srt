00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Ember uses what's called the model view
controller, or MVC pattern, for

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,070
organizing your code.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,480
There are an awful lot of implementations
of the MVC pattern.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,000
So, if you're familiar with MVC from Ruby
on Rails, or BackBone JS, or maybe KoKo,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,810
be prepared that just your understandings
of the term is how Ember uses them.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,250
In Ember, templates describe how your user
interface looks.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,480
They're written in the handlebar as
templating language,

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,520
which looks an awful lot like HTML.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,540
In addition to normal HTML, templates can
contain

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,210
expressions like curly braces, title, end
double curly braces,

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,570
which allow you to insert dynamic
information into your pages.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,790
Controllers define how your user interface
behaves,

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,550
based on information about the application
state,

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,900
such as whether something on the page is
showing or hidden.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,090
And they use JavaScript methods to define
behavior,

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,400
such as popping up an alert when a certain
part of the page is clicked.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,160
They also act as a proxy between your
templates and your models.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,280
Models store data.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Any information that should stick around
after the page is refreshed, or

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,640
the browser is closed and reopened, get's
stored in a model.

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,130
If you're app stands alone by itself,

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,420
the model might store it's information in
the browser's local storage.

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,555
If your app is the user interface to a
backend web server,

24
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:34,030
then the model might store its information
through Ajax.

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,550
Routes load a model, controller, and
template.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,510
For example, in our blogging app, the post
route might load

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:49,060
the post.hbs handlebars template, the
post.js controller, and

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,080
retrieve a particular blog post from the
back end database to be used as the model.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,590
And finally, the router maps a URL to a
route.

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:08,100
So, if our app is at www.draculasblog.com
and we wanted draculasblog.com/posts/5.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,140
To load the blog post with the idea of
five, we create an entry in

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,950
the router that mapped slash posts slash
five to the post route.
