1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,320
Before we can start building our blogging
app, we'll need to create our

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,130
directory structure, gather our
dependencies, and boot our Ember app.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,840
To make it easier for you to get started,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,110
I've set up a work space that comes with
all of the files and folders you'll need.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,120
If you just wanna use the work space,

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,140
click the Launch work spaces button next
to this video.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,960
I'd still recommend watching the rest of
this video though, so

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,690
that you can understand what everything is
for.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,500
Let's start by setting up our project
directory.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,560
We'll make a new folder called blogger.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,350
I'm going to put it in my home directory,
but you can put it anywhere you like.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,425
If you're using Windows or

13
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:43,160
Linux it might look a little different,
but you can follow along just the same.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,625
In this blogger folder we'll make

15
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:55,079
folders for CSS, libs, routes,

16
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,650
models, controllers, and, templates.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,100
Than we'll open this whole folder up in
the Sublime text editor.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,692
Now, we'll also make a file called
index.html and

19
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:17,990
in it we'll make a bare bones HTML
document.

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,989
Now, we'll start gathering our
dependencies.

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,660
Ember uses semantic versioning to help you
identify the best version to use.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,320
Here's how semantic versioning works.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,490
Right now the latest version of Ember JS
is 1.7.0.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,180
Let's say the Ember team finds a small bug
and wants to release a new version.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,360
As long as all they do is fix that bug and

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,530
don't make any changes that could break an
app that depends on Ember,

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,770
they'll release the new version as 1.7.1,
incrementing the last of

28
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,620
the three version numbers, which is called
the patch version.

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,070
Now let's say that the Ember team has been
hard at work.

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,450
And they're ready to release a new version
with a bunch of awesome features.

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,140
So long as none of these features make
changes that can break an app that's built

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,520
with Ember 1.7.something, they'll release
the new version as 1.8.0.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,660
Incrementing the middle of the three
version numbers,

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,330
which is called the minor version, and
resetting the patch version down to zero.

35
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,500
At some point, the Ember team will have
eventually built some

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,690
awesome new stuff that changes how things
work.

37
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,460
And they may also want to remove some
functionality that they

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,800
discover makes Ember slower.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
At this point when they release a version
that breaks backwards

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,960
compatibility they'll change the version
to 2.0.0.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,490
Incrementing the first of the three
version numbers which is

42
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,410
called major version and resetting the
minor and patch versions to zero.

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,570
I'm going to be using Ember 1.7.0 since
it's the most recent version, but

44
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,960
you should use whatever the latest version
of Ember 1.something.something is.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,340
In other words, the latest version so long
as it's less than 2.0.0.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,370
By sticking to a 1.something release, you
can be sure that as you follow along,

47
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,620
you won't run into anything that's
incompatible.

48
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,620
>> To download Ember, go to emberjs.com,
click on Builds,

49
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,170
then Release, and then the big Download
button.

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,980
If 2.0.0 or later has been released and
you need to find

51
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,000
the latest 1.something build, you might
need to go to Tagged releases to find it.

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,550
The other thing we need from the Ember
website is the handlebars library.

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,700
Back on the home page there's a handlebars
link.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,090
Click it to download the handlebars.

55
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,550
We'll be using version 1.3.0.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,220
So, if you're watching this video a while
after it was made,

57
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,850
make sure you're using the latest
1.something version.

58
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,540
Ember relies on jQuery, so we need to
download jQuery as well.

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,990
From jquery.com, we'll click the big
Download button.

60
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,990
And download the latest, uncompressed
development 1.something version.

61
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,060
Finally, I made a little library that
we'll use to

62
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,680
load our handlebars templates, called
Ember Handlebars Loader.

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,170
You can download it from the link in the
teacher's notes.

64
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,170
Here, it'll bring us to the repository.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,240
Click the Library > Raw > File > Save Page
As.

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,030
Now, let's copy all of these JavaScript
libraries to our lib folder.

67
00:04:56,655 --> 00:05:02,311
Then in our index.html file we'll

68
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:07,974
add script tags to put them in here.

69
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:16,799
[SOUND]
In addition to these

70
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:25,224
JavaScript libraries,

71
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:30,438
we'll also use

72
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:38,863
the Bootstrap framework

73
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:44,887
to style our app.

74
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm going to be using version 3.2.0.

75
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,565
So once again, make sure you use the
latest 3.something.

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,490
We'll copy the bootstrap CSS into our CSS
Folder.

77
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,895
And then in our index.html, we'll add a
link for it.

78
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:10,473
[SOUND] Let's open our index.html page in

79
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:16,109
the browser to make sure there aren't any
errors.

80
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,028
We'll pop open the JavaScript console.

81
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:26,660
If we've mistyped something, you'll see an
error like I have here.

82
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,760
It says, file not found.

83
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,381
There I say, v.1.3.0.

84
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:35,758
It should just be v1.3.0.

85
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:40,640
And ember1.7.0 should be just ember.

86
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,100
Now, if I refresh the page, there we go.

87
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,670
No errors.

88
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,970
Now, the final thing we need to do before
we get started is to

89
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,452
create our actual Ember app.

90
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,814
We make a file called blogger.js.

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,760
And in it, we will write blogger equals
ember.application.create.

92
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,160
Back in our index.html, we will add a
script tag after our dependencies.

93
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,160
Then we will go back to the browser.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,918
And refresh the page.

95
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,304
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,032
If everything has gone right and

97
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:30,900
your Ember app has booted, you'll see a
blank page like this.

98
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,810
But in your JavaScript console, you'll see
something that looks like this.

99
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,090
These debug messages are printed by Ember
when it boots.

100
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,270
And it means that your shiny, brand new
Ember app is now ready for

101
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,360
you to start building on.

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,470
The last thing we need to do before
starting is to serve our

103
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,510
app with a web server.

104
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,650
This is necessary to load the handlebars
template starting in the next lesson.

105
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,094
There are a lot of ways to start a server
but

106
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:03,506
the easiest is to download Mongoose from
cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml.

107
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:10,072
[BLANK_AUDIO]

108
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,817
Then we can copy it into our project
folder.

109
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:17,905
[BLANK_AUDIO]

110
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,500
And just double-click it to open it.

111
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,220
I'm gonna use the Cmd+Alt+J keyboard
shortcut to look,

112
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,200
to open my JavaScript console, and there
we go.

113
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,940
It's open in here.

114
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,910
If you see an error like this, where is
says something about bootstrap.css.map,

115
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:40,250
you can just go to your CSS folder, open
Bootstrap.

116
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,200
Go all the way to the end and then delete
this line.

117
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,800
Save the file, go back here, click
Refresh, and it'll go away.

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,620
If you're on a Mac and are comfortable in
the terminal,

119
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,730
you can also start a web server without
downloading anything at all.

120
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Just open terminal.

121
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,949
Change directories to your project folder
and

122
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,551
run python -m SimpleHTTPServer.

123
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,844
Then in

124
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:20,900
your browser visit 0.0.0.0:8000.

125
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,070
Once again, if we

126
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,020
open the JavaScript console, we can see
that our app is running.

127
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,140
Now, with that, we're ready to start
building our Ember app.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,875
The last thing we need to do before
starting is to

129
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,300
serve our app with a web server.

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,130
This is necessary to load the handlebars
templates starting in the next lesson.

131
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,440
There are a lot of ways to start a server,
but

132
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,780
the easiest is to download Mongoose from
the link in the teacher's notes.

133
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,520
Copy it into your project directory, then
open it up.

134
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,820
If you're on Mac and are comfortable on
the terminal,

135
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,800
you can also start a web server without
downloading anything at all.

136
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,520
Just open terminal, changer directories
into your project directory and

137
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,400
run python -m simplehttpserver.

138
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,615
Then in your browser, visit 0.0.0.0:8000.

139
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,300
And with that, we are ready to start
building our Ember wrap.

140
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,250
As you go through these videos, I strongly
suggest you take the following approach.

141
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,700
First, simply watch the video.

142
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,880
Don't bother taking notes or following
along,

143
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,910
just focus on getting the high level
understanding of the concept being taught.

144
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,390
Second, rewatch the video, pausing as it
goes and writing the code along with it.

145
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,930
This step will cement the nitty gritty of
how the code works and

146
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,680
start to ingrain your understanding.

147
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,190
Third, create a separate project.

148
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,240
And apply what I've shown you to your own
project.

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,100
For example, maybe make an app for an
animal shelter that shows

150
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,030
information about the shelter and a list
of animals available for adoption.

151
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,800
Take the ideas I cover in the video, and
then apply them to your own project.

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,370
It's this step where your deepest learning
will happen.

153
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,000
Start with this process now, rewatch this
video, following along.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,712
And then, make the beginnings of your own
app.
