1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,370
The last concept we'll learn about the
router and templates is nesting.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,990
What I want to do is, instead of showing
the phone and

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,430
email address on the contact page, replace
these with links for phone and email.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,150
And if I click the phone link, it shows
the number over here, and

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,690
if I click the email link, it shows the
email address over here.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,623
Here's the completed feature, so you can
see what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:29,475
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:33,066
We'll start out by just building a new
page for phone.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,930
We'll make a route.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,476
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,578
And a template.

12
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:45,361
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,559
And then, of course, we'll load the
template.

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,347
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:57,180
And we'll change our contact.hbs template
to link to the phone page and

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,096
our future email page.

17
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:02,129
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,100
Now let's check this out.

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,520
We'll refresh here.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,630
Uh-oh.

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,530
Oh, we can't link to the route email until
we actually make it.

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,610
Let's go back.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,122
We'll add this later.

24
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:22,030
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,620
There we go.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,110
We'll click phone, and there it is.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,690
Nothing new there.

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,855
You understand this by now.

29
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:34,050
But watch this.

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,050
Back here, we'll change the router.

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,750
We'll take this.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,440
We'll remove it for just a moment.

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,350
And then we'll add this function.

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,070
This is what we call a nested route.

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,580
The last thing we need to do is in our
contact page,

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,260
we're gonna add a new handlebars helper.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,300
Now, if we go back to our app, refresh the
page.

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,690
If we click Phone, it shows up here at the
bottom of the screen.

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,560
That's right where our outlet helper is.

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,576
Gonna back up a second.

41
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:30,679
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:34,880
And we'll add the outlet handlebars helper
to our contact template.

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:45,860
Now, if we go back to the app, refresh the
page, and we click Phone.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,350
The phone template gets rendered right
where that outlet helper is.

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,760
Anywhere that you add an outlet helper,

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,310
a nested route will get rendered into that
spot.

47
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,011
Finally, we can easily add two columns
using Bootstrap styles to our page to

48
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,398
get the desired layout.

49
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:13,398
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,382
And let's check it out.

51
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,610
There it is.

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,240
See how simple it is to make a nested
route?

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,390
That's one of the great things about
Ember.

54
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,410
It makes it really easy to create complex
user interfaces, and

55
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,160
you can even nest routes within other
nested routes.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,013
Let's add that nested route for email now.

57
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:55,803
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,305
Create our email template.

59
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:01,287
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,188
We'll load the template.

61
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:08,724
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,640
Gonna make this a little easier to read.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,260
[BLANK_AUDIO]

64
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,229
And now if we go back to our app.

65
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,876
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,671
Oh, we need to add the email link.

67
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:33,671
[BLANK_AUDIO]

68
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,730
Refresh, click Email, there we go.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,230
Really easy.

70
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,840
The email template gets loaded into the
outlet helper location as well.

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,540
As a gentle reminder remember to rewatch
this video and

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,282
follow along as well as build out some
nested routes on your own app.

73
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,690
I'm going to stop reminding you now and
just assume you'll do so from now on.
