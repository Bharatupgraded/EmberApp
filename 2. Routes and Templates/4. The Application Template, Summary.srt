1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,820
Before we move on to controllers, l wanna
clean up some of our code.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,390
On every page, we're adding the same Nav
bar over and over.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,420
If we ever want to change that nav bar say
by adding another link or

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,540
maybe a logo on one side.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,370
We'd have to change it in several places.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,300
That's not good code.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,350
Here's how we fix that up.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,985
Or make a template called application.hps.

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:34,130
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,090
Add it, to our handle bars loader and then
in it.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,239
Let me close a couple of these to make
things easier to read.

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,462
In it but all the stuff that's on every
page.

13
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:56,007
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:56,007 --> 00:01:01,922
And then an outlet helper.

15
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:07,209
And then on each one of these templates
I'm gonna remove all this extra code.

16
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:17,209
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,929
Let's take a look.

18
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,500
Still seems to work just fine.

19
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,840
So if you have this application.hbs
template

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
it's automatically loaded when your Ember
app starts up.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,690
And then every subsequent template is
rendered into its outlet.

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,400
So now in all of our other templates we
don't have to have the Nav bar or

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
the div class container.

24
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,980
So to recap, when you visit a URL, the
router looks up the path and

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,930
matches it to a route.

26
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,380
The route loads a template with the same
name.

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,810
If the route is nested, the parent route
is loaded and

28
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,190
the child route is loaded into the outlet
helper of the parent.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,890
There's also an implicit application route
that all other routes are loaded into.

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,860
If you create an application .hbs template
with an outlet helper all other

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,840
templates will automatically get rendered
into that outlet.

32
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,120
One thing you should get comfortable with
in Ember,

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,520
is the idea of convention over
configuration.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,500
There's a lot of seemingly magical things
that Ember does for you.

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,430
Such as creating this implicit application
route.

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,920
These features are designed to let you
implement common patterns in your app.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,910
Often without writing any code at all.

38
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,890
An important part of becoming an Ember
developer, is embracing convention over

39
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,470
configuration and following the path that
the Ember authors have laid out for you.
