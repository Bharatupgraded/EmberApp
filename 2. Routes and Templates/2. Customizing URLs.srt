1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,370
The last concept we'll learn about the
router and templates is nesting.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,990
What I wanna do is instead of showing the
phone and

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,430
email address on the contact page, replace
these with links for phone and email.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,060
And if I click the phone link, it shows
the number over here.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,690
And if click the email link, it shows the
email address over here.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,997
Here's the completed feature, so you can
see what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:29,541
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,220
We'll start out by just building a new
page for phone.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,030
Make a route.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,006
[SOUND] And a template.

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:45,045
[SOUND] And then of course,

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:51,365
we'll load the template.

13
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:55,813
And we'll change our contact.hps template
to link to

14
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:59,110
the phone page in our future email page.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,100
Now, let's check this out.

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,520
I'll refresh here.

17
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,662
oh.

18
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,530
Oh, we can't link to the route email until
we actually make it.

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,610
Let's go back.

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,549
We'll add this later.

21
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,529
[SOUND]
There we go.

22
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:27,895
We'll click phone and there it is.

23
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:29,690
Nothing new there.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,858
You understand this by now.

25
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:34,050
But watch this.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,213
Back here, we'll change the router, take
this and

27
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:48,350
we'll remove it for just a moment and then
we'll add this function.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,070
This is what we call a nested route.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,618
The last thing we need to do is in our
contact page,

30
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,260
we're gonna add a new handlebars helper.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,300
Now, if we go back to our app, refresh the
page.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,690
If we click phone, it shows up here at the
bottom of the screen.

33
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,625
That's right where our outlet helper is
gonna back up a second.

34
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:29,209
[SOUND] And we'll add the outlet handle

35
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:36,795
bars helper to our contact template.

36
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:42,370
Now, if we go back to the app, refresh the
page.

37
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,860
And we click phone,

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,350
the phone template gets rendered right
where that outlet helper is.

39
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,760
Anywhere that you add an outlet helper,

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,310
a nested route will get rendered into that
spot.

41
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,826
Finally, we can easily add two columns
using Bootstrap styles to

42
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,026
our page to get the desired layout.

43
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:14,026
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,760
And let's check it out.

45
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,610
There it is.

46
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,240
See how simple it is to make a nested
route?

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,390
That's one of the great things about
Ember.

48
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,310
It makes it really easy to create complex
use interfaces.

49
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,160
And you can even nest routes within other
nested routes.

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,438
Let's add that nested route for email now.

51
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:55,850
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,490
Create our email template.

53
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,465
We'll load the template.

54
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:10,585
Gonna make it a little easier to read.

55
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:18,123
[SOUND] And now, if we go back to our app,

56
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:23,841
we need to add the email link.

57
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:34,587
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:36,620
Refresh.

59
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,220
Click email.

60
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,730
There we go.

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,230
Really easy.

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,840
And the email template gets loaded into
the outlet helper location as well.

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,800
As a gentle reminder, remember re-watch
this video and follow along.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,290
As well as build out some nested routes on
your own app.

65
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,690
I'm gonna stop reminding you now, and just
assume you'll do so from now on.
