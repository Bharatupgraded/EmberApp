00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,520
There's one annoying thing I wanna fix
before we move on.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,590
If we load up our app.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,800
Just the homepage here.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,750
We just get a blank page.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,750
Here's how we change that.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,390
We'll open our router.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,769
And then, since I want this to be the
homepage, I'll add path /.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,677
Save it.

9
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:30,612
Then I'll refresh.

10
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:34,010
And there we go.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,980
So what's going on here?

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,770
By default, the path to a page is the same
as the name of the entry in the router.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,090
So for example, for our about route.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,300
If we go here, the about path loads the
about route.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,230
But we can override that by providing a
path explicitly.

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,790
Here, we've provided the path to the
homepage.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,125
If we wanted to, we could overwrite it for
other entries too.

18
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:14,678
[SOUND] So now, if we go to about-us,

19
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:18,586
that won't work.

20
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:21,560
But if we add about-us, it will work.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,004
It goes to the about route.

22
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:31,760
Or we could say something like path
get-in-touch.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,560
Generally though, it's a good idea to pick
names for your routes.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,330
It's the same as the path you'd like in
the URL.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,240
So that it's easy to find things in your
code.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,660
But for the root path, or

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,650
other special situations, you now know how
to override the default.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,380
Except for that root path.

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,292
Let's switch it back to the defaults.

30
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:57,779
