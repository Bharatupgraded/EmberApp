00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,720
Most Ember apps interact with a backend
server using Ajax,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,800
rather than just purely using local
storage.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,700
For example, in a real blogging app, you'd
wanna save your posts to

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,650
a server where all your blog readers could
retrieve them.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,680
You'd also wanna add authentication and

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,390
authorization, so only the blog owner
could create, update and delete posts.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,500
And you might want to require users to
sign in before commenting.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,384
Since this course is specifically about
Ember and

9
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:33,289
not about building backend servers, I'm
not going to

10
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:37,580
go into depth about how to build a backend
server to use with Ember.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,200
But I will show you easy how it is to use
Ember with an already set up server.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,085
If you don't know how to, I'd suggest
exploring Ruby on Rails or Python and

13
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:52,070
Django to learn how to create a backend
server yourself.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,750
The rest of this video won't make much
sense if you haven't built a web

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,730
server with a API yet.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,990
By default, Ember Data assumes that it
will store and

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,250
retrieve information through a backend
server using Ajax.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,900
It will assume that your server provides a
JSON REST API.

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,910
Explaining the nuances of JSON and REST is
outside the scope of this course.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,300
But if you aren't familiar with them, just
know that JSON is a standard format

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,830
in which data is represented in a similar
way to JavaScript object.

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,420
And REST is a standard way of using HTTP
verbs, like GET and

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,380
POST to represent what you want to do with
your data.

24
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,520
For this video,

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm going to download my project from
WorkSpaces onto my local computer.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,628
[SOUND] Like I mentioned in the first
stage,

27
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:49,586
I'll need to use a web server to run my
app.

28
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:57,167
[SOUND] So I'll copy Mongoose into

29
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:03,671
my App folder and open it up.

30
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,906
Now we have our app running locally and
we're ready to get started working on it.

31
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:12,577
I'm going to open up our code in the
Sublime Text editor for us to work on.

32
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:14,682
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:18,640
Since the rest adapter is the default
adapter for Ember Data.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,850
To switch from the local storage adapter
to the rest adapter.

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,430
We can simply open our index.html, and

36
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,620
remove the local storage adapter from the
script tags, and store.js.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,090
We'll save this, and refresh our app.

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm gonna open up the JavaScript console,
so we can see what happens as we go.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,850
So we'll refresh the app.

40
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:47,430
Down here, you can see that it says get,
I'm in the same

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,890
host and port that we're on and /posts 404
Not found.

42
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,352
That's because the route for the homepage
loads the model.

43
00:02:56,352 --> 00:03:04,821
[SOUND] This.store.findpost which
retrieves all of the posts.

44
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:12,272
In a rest API, retrieving all of the posts
happens through a get request to /posts.

45
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:15,133
There's the /posts and there's the get.

46
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,206
And Ember data,

47
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:21,273
by default, makes the request to the same
host import as the app is running on.

48
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:28,347
Here to 192.168.1.86 port 8080.

49
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:31,510
Now, we could load up our back end server
app.

50
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,900
Let's say that it's running on local host
3000.

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,666
And configure Ember data to make requests
to local host 3,000 instead

52
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:45,520
of to 192.168.1.86 port 8080.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,280
But browser security policies by

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,410
default prevent Ajax requests across
domains and ports.

55
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,160
There are ways around this using cross
origin resource sharing or cores.

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,950
But we'd have to configure cores, and it
doesn't work on older browsers.

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,850
The easiest way is simply to have our
backend app also serve up our Ember app.

58
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,490
I'm using Rails for my backend app.

59
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:19,420
And in Rails, I can simply copy the Ember
app into the Public folder.

60
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,540
And it will be served up as static
content.

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,206
If you're using a different backend app,

62
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,020
you'll have to move your files
accordingly.

63
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,447
Now, I'll fire up my Rails server.

64
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:37,583
[SOUND] My Rails server runs

65
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:43,655
on 0.0.0.03000.

66
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,970
I'm gonna make it so that we can see both
of these at the same time.

67
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,070
When I visit the homepage, since
index.html is in my public folder.

68
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,300
It gets loaded up, and my Ember app is
displayed.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,760
After the Ember app loads and
this.store.find post is run,

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,340
you can see that the Rails server has
received a GET request for /posts.

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,655
Let's keep going through the app and see
how it interacts with the backend.

72
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:20,224
[SOUND] When we save a new post, it makes
a post request

73
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:27,636
to /posts to create the new record on the
backend.

74
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:31,298
Then, when the app transitions us back to
the post route,

75
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:36,140
it makes a get request to /posts again, to
retrieve all of the posts.

76
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,520
And here's our post.

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
When we clicked to view it, we can see it
here.

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,732
It doesn't trigger another request because
this post has

79
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:48,250
already been loaded from get/posts, which
loaded all of the posts.

80
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,180
But if we refresh the app so that all of
the data is cleared from memory.

81
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,150
Now, we can see that it makes the get
request to our

82
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,890
backend server to retrieve that post.

83
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,530
All of this is based on the conventions of
a JSON REST API.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,890
Ember Data makes it really easy for

85
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,070
your client-side app to interact with your
backend.

86
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,800
If you build out a restful JSON API for
your backend, you can never write

87
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,210
a single line of persistence code and just
let Ember do all of the work.

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,220
And if you don't have control over your
backend server, perhaps because it's

89
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,380
already built, or because another team on
your project makes decisions about it.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,460
There are ways to customize Ember data
adapters, so

91
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,360
that you don't have to right the same Ajax
calls over and over again.
