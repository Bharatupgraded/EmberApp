00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,170
We haven't done much with our comments
yet.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,280
I'd like a way to add a new comment to a
blog post and

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,890
to display all of the comments for posts
below the body.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,930
Here's how it looks on the finished app.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,263
To define a relationship like this in
Ember, we'll update our models.

6
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:24,764
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:30,957
Here this line sets up

8
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:38,450
a property on each instance of post called
comments.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,515
That returns all of the comments with that
posts ID.

10
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:45,960
ds.hasMany is an embered data method and

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,080
it makes the relationship with the comment
model.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,790
Don't worry too much about the async
truebit here.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,250
It's something that's going to become the
default by embered data 1.0 in

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,700
all likelihood.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,160
Just know that you always need to include
it when you're defining a relationship

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,550
with the local storage adapter.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,400
So, now post has a property called
comments that returns all of

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,510
the comments for that post.

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,020
We can also setup the other side of the
relationship.

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,620
We can make a post property.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,149
This value is DS.belongsTo.

22
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,870
[SOUND] And now if you take a comment
object and

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,974
access the post property it will return
the post

24
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:40,473
whose ID matches the post ID stored in the
comment.

25
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:45,666
With our models set up let's update our
post.hps handle bars template to

26
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,029
use this new comments property.

27
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:55,670
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,971
[SOUND]

29
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:06,287
Here we're using the each handlebars
helper again, but this time we

30
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:11,841
don't wanna loop through the model itself,
but rather a property on the model.

31
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,510
All of the comments.

32
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,570
So we explicitly say the property name
that we want to loop through.

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,140
Now for

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,440
each comment we'll display a paragraph
with the text property of that comment.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,810
Of course we don't have any comments yet
and we'll need a page for adding them.

36
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,320
We'll start with a router entry.

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,950
I want to display this on a post page so
I'm gonna make this a nested route.

38
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:48,236
[SOUND] Now, let's add a link to the post
template.

39
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:56,681
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,985
So, we're linking to the new comment
route.

41
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,808
But, because it's nested inside here we
need to provide a value for

42
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,800
the dynamic segment.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,380
You do that by passing in this.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,890
Which refers to the model for the route
that we're currently on.

45
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,790
And then we'll extract the ID.

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,220
We'll add a little bit of styling.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,580
Now when that link is clicked,

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,180
I want the new comment box to show up on
the bottom of the page.

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,540
So, I'm gonna add an outlet there.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,427
Now, we'll need a template for the
new-comment route.

51
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:40,234
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,938
We need to load this from our index.html.

53
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:50,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,125
Let's make this a subheading since it's
gonna be displayed within that

55
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:54,837
other route.

56
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:57,617
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,615
And we'll make a form for the new comment.

58
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:09,931
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,360
And we use the text area Handlebars
helper.

60
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,520
Bind it to the text property.

61
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,930
And add a submit button, and action his
name is save.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,650
And then we'll need a controller to handle
the save action.

63
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,886
Run a script tag for it.

64
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:53,886
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:00,038
Define that save action.

66
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:07,649
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:15,892
Create a record for the comment.

68
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:22,480
The text will be the value of the text
property on the controller.

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,350
Then we'll save the comment.

70
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,240
But now we've run into a new problem.

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,750
Our new comment route is nested within the
post route and

72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,850
we want to associate the comment with post
we are looking at.

73
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,320
But how do we get access to the post?

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,990
How can we find out what this post ID is?

75
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,990
When you need to access information in one
controller from another.

76
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,460
Ember provides a simple hook called needs.

77
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,120
In the needs hook you simple list any
controllers you need access to.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,380
Here we've said we need the post
controller.

79
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,565
Now we'll move down and make use of this.

80
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:06,473
[SOUND] Thanks to the needs, we can get
the controller's property of the current

81
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:12,673
controller, and then get the post
controller and ask it for its model.

82
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,880
Next we'll make the association.

83
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,190
We'll ask the post for its comments.

84
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,460
And we'll call the pushObject method, and
pass in the comment that we just created.

85
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,390
And then we'll save the post.

86
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,520
And that's how you create an association
between two models in Ember.

87
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,700
Finally, we'll transition to,

88
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,770
the post's route for the post that we just
commented on.

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's make sure this works in the browser
now.

90
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,920
[BLANK_AUDIO]

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,213
Let's open our Java Script console.

92
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:56,391
Looks like we have a syntax error in
post.js line four and

93
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,316
comment.js line three.

94
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:03,740
So here in comment.js I've put a semicolon
where there shouldn't be one.

95
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,780
Probably did the same in post.

96
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,280
Yep.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,290
That made it so our models couldn't load.

98
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,320
Let's refresh.

99
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,507
And now let's add a comment.

100
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:21,886
[BLANK_AUDIO]

101
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:22,915
And there it is.
