1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's add the ability to create new posts.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:11,343
We'll start out by adding a new post route
[SOUND].

3
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:16,660
Then on our homepage, on the posts
template, we'll add a link to it.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,230
And here, in the link to handle parse
[INAUDIBLE], if you want to add a class or

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,830
multiple classes to the HTML element,

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,369
we use class names as one of the
properties in the link to helper.

7
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:37,709
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:42,544
And then we'll make a template,

9
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:48,596
[NOISE] It'll load it in our index.html.

10
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:56,797
[NOISE] And in the template, we'll have a
title of new post.

11
00:00:56,797 --> 00:01:02,472
And then I'm just gonna copy the form from
when we're editing a post.

12
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,515
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:07,652
Pretty much the same thing.

14
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:12,979
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,120
So now we need to define this save action
for the new post controller

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,940
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,313
And one descript tag for that

18
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:36,356
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,708
Now let's make the controller.

20
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:43,230
And we aren't gonna load up a model.

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,980
So we can just use the regular old Ember
controller.

22
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,120
Remember, our action was called Save.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,267
So let's define that here [NOISE] so

24
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:03,884
we'll make a new post object.

25
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:10,110
Here's how we do that with ember data,
this.store.createRecord and

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,560
then the first argument will be the name
of the model that we want to create.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
The post.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,030
The second argument will be the value of
the properties.

29
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,330
So we'll have a title.

30
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,060
And the title we want to get from

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,160
the property that's set here on the
controller.

32
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,680
To do that, we run this get title.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,670
Remember how in Ember, we have to set
properties using this dot

34
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,030
set rather than accessing directly That's
very similar to what we're doing here,

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,470
whenever we wanna get access to a
property.

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,200
Where as in regular Java Script,

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,000
we might just say this dot title in Ember
we have to say this dot get title.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,340
So that Ember knows to update the value
when it's changed in

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,480
another part of the app.

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,910
Similarly, for the body, use the stop get
body.

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,920
So now we have our new post that's an
Ember data object, and

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,180
to save it into local storage, you just
run newPost dot save.

43
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,240
Before we do that, the object only exists
in memory.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,950
This persists it to local storage.

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,990
Finally, we'll call this.transitionToRoute
('posts')

46
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,330
which is fairly self explanatory.

47
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,180
It'll transition our app to the posts
route.

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,855
Let's go and take a look at how this works
in our page.

49
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:42,655
[SOUND]

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:51,016
There we go.

51
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,680
It gets saved.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,930
It shows up here we're transitioned back
to the posts throughout.

53
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,960
And if we refresh our app, it's still
there

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,870
because we've saved it into the browser's
local storage.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,490
Now if we click on a post, you'll notice
that the IDs have

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,430
changed from being numbers to being funny
strings of letter and numbers.

57
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,100
That's just part of how the local storage
adapter works.

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,980
So don't worry about it.

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,750
The last thing we should do is allow users
to delete a post.

60
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,300
First, we'll update the post.hps template

61
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,890
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,599
We'll add a button with

63
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:45,029
the action, delete.

64
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:53,595
Then, we'll define that action in our post
controller.

65
00:04:53,595 --> 00:05:03,218
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,516
We wanna confirm before just deleting in
case the user

67
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,795
accidentally clicks the button.

68
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:15,080
[NOISE]
And if they are sure

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,710
look at the model and then we'll call
destroyRecord, which is

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,313
the ember data method to remove an object
both from memory and from local storage.

71
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:32,548
Then, we'll transition to

72
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:36,444
the post route and

73
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:43,207
let's check it out in our app.

74
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:48,220
Click Delete, say we're sure and it's
deleted
