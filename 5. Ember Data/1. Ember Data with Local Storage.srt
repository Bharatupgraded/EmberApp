00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,834
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:07,827
Up until now, all of our data has been
retrieved from

3
00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:11,690
pre-built JavaScript objects loaded into
memory.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,150
Most real apps need a more flexible data
store, where they can save and

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,328
retrieve information.

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:22,075
Usually, either client-side, using the
local storage HTML5 feature,

7
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:24,520
or server-side, using Ajax.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,580
For both of these scenarios and many
others, Ember has

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,420
a library called Ember Data that makes it
much more pleasant to work with your

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,640
data by simplifying complex interactions
and automating repetitive tasks.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,510
If you're using Workspaces, I've already
downloaded and

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,030
set up the following tools for you.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,434
If not, you can down download ember data
from emberjs.com.

14
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:50,180
Click Builds.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,720
And then tagged Releases.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,010
And scroll all the way to the bottom and
find the link for tags/v1.0.0 beta 10.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,860
And here it is.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,610
And then save this file to your computer.

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,720
Because Ember data is still in beta, some
things might change slightly if you're

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,590
watching this video a while after I make
it.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,010
So, I'd suggest you stick with the exact
same version I'm using.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,020
At least until you get through these
lessons and

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,050
are more comfortable figuring out what may
have changed.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,310
For most of these lessons, we'll use Ember
data to just save information locally on

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,810
our browser using local storage.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,070
And so we'll need to get a local storage
adapter to use with Ember data.

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,470
From the link in the teacher's notes,

28
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,170
scroll down, click the local storage
adapter.js file.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,690
Then raw and then save it to your
computer,

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,210
just like I've done here in the workspace.

31
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,090
Move both libraries into your apps lib
folder.

32
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,440
Ember data and the local storage adapter.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,660
And add script tags for them in your
index.html.

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,260
Now, let's go into our store.js file.

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,550
Delete everything in it.

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,000
And we'll replace it with this code.

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,667
This simply sets up ember to use Ember
data with the local storage adapter.

38
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:26,326
[SOUND] Once again, blogger refers to our
Ember app.

39
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,352
And now we have something new.

40
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:32,270
DS, which stands for data store which is
how we call Ember data.

41
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,400
Now, let's go through our program and

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,730
update our code to use ember data instead
of plain old JavaScript objects.

43
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:45,570
First, unlike with plain old Java script
objects,

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,040
we need to define our models to specify
what properties they will have.

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,630
Here in our models folder, is where we'll
do that.

46
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,380
We'll start with a file called post.js.

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,830
We always use a singular word for our
model names in Ember data.

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,720
We will add a script data for this.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,194
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:20,730
In here, we'll write blogger.post for the
model name equals DS.model.extend.

51
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,690
This creates an Ember data model.

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,170
And then we'll specify the properties of
this new class.

53
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,590
It has a title and it has a body.

54
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,030
So to specify the properties of our model,

55
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,210
we pass in an object whose properties are
the properties of the new class.

56
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,320
The values are always DS.attr.

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,910
Let's make another model for our comments.

58
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,558
We'll create a file called comment.js.

59
00:03:54,558 --> 00:04:00,480
[SOUND] Add a script tag.

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,284
[SOUND] And then we'll define the model.

61
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:13,123
[SOUND]

62
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:22,802
Very easy.

63
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:27,700
Note that for both models we didn't
include the ID property.

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,440
Ember data automatically sets it.

65
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,050
Now, let's update our app to use these
models.

66
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,762
We'll start with the model we return in
the posts route.

67
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:43,040
This .store returns

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,810
the data store which is Ember data's way
of referring to where we save things.

69
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,520
Then we call the find method and pass in
the name of the model as a string.

70
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,230
This will return every instance of the
post model.

71
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,110
Let's refresh our app and see if it's
working.

72
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,200
Check our JavaScript console for errors.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,598
Error will processing route posts posts is
not defined.

74
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:16,099
Post.js line 3.

75
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,877
[SOUND] Oh,

76
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:26,602
I'm editing the wrong file.

77
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,500
Here I edited the post.js file.

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,102
I should have been editing the posts.js
file.

79
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:36,968
Let's copy this over to posts.js.

80
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:43,861
We'll save it, refresh.

81
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,710
There we go.

82
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,300
And you can see there's no posts being
displayed because we

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,900
haven't actually saved any into our new
Ember data local storage data store.

84
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,485
Now, let's update our recent comments
route.

85
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:04,545
[SOUND] Once again, this will return

86
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:13,040
all of the comments that we have in our
data store.

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,218
We'll refresh.

88
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:18,820
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,070
We'll click recent comments.

90
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,440
And there are no recent comments.

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,236
Now, let's work on displaying a single
post.

92
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:34,165
[SOUND] In a route, we'll make one change
to how we retrieve them.

93
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:40,706
[SOUND] It's almost the same as retrieving
every post object.

94
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:43,900
But here we've passed in a second
argument.

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,040
The ID of the post that we want to
retrieve.

96
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,914
That will return just that one single
post.

97
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,050
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,470
Let's go back here.

99
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,060
Refresh.

100
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,490
And it all seems to work.

101
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,050
In the next video, we'll see how to create
new posts so

102
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,350
that we can see more of the results of our
work
