00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,254
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:08,723
[SOUND] The last major part of emberitic
cover is models.

3
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:13,397
Models are used to handle data that should
be saved permanently, either locally on

4
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:18,610
the browser or by making web requests to a
server that saves the information.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,030
We'll start off by using JavaScript
objects that are saved in memory.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,560
Then we'll switch to using Ember Data,
which is a library for

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,510
robustly managing model data in Ember
apps.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,390
First we'll use Ember Data to save data in
our browser's local storage.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,560
Then we'll see how to switch it to use
AJAX to save our data to a server.

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,240
We'll begin by using JavaScript objects
that will be loaded into memory.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,740
You'd never actually build an Ember app
this way, but

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,200
it will keep things simple as we begin to
explore what models can do for us.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,040
To start we'll define some sample blog
posts and

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:03,080
comments as JavaScript objects in a new
file called store.js or data store.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,940
You can see here we have an array of posts
that contains

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,200
JavaScript objects with properties for id,
title, and body.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,486
Then we have an array for comments that
contains JavaScript objects with an id,

18
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:23,530
a post id, and the comment text.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,996
We'll add a script tag to our index.html
to include the data in our app.

20
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:34,484
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:38,993
Now, I want to switch our posts route from
using the hardcoded post titles in

22
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:41,882
the template to using the post titles
loaded from

23
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:45,830
the JavaScript objects we're going to use
as models.

24
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,104
But first, let's revisit how the different
pieces of Ember fit together.

25
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:55,108
[SOUND] Remember when you visit a URL
Ember looks up the path from the router,

26
00:01:55,108 --> 00:02:00,926
finds a match, and then loads a route that
loads a template, controller, and model.

27
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,077
By default a route loads a template and

28
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:06,480
a controller with the same name as the
route.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,460
So the posts route loads the posts
template and the posts controller.

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,640
But there's no default for

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,220
what model gets loaded, so we have to
specify that ourselves.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,960
Let's actually start off by writing a
posts route that

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,090
explicitly loads the posts template and
the posts controller.

34
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,430
Just so you can see what that looks like.

35
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,220
In our routes folder, we'll make a post.js
file.

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,679
We'll add a script tag for it to our
index.html.

37
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:41,699
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,874
And then, in it,

39
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:52,590
we'll write Blogger.PostsRoute, quotes
Ember.Route.extend.

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,600
This should look pretty familiar to you
from writing controllers.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,450
Here we take the app, the Ember app that
we've created.

42
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,890
We save a name of the route capitalized.

43
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,640
And then we add the word Route onto the
end.

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,988
We set that property equal to this object
where we've taken Ember.

45
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:16,890
We've invoked the route property.

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,601
We've called the extend method to subclass
the Ember.Route.

47
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:28,160
In here, we, we'll set the controller name
to posts.

48
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,045
And we'll tell it to render the template.

49
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:38,848
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,010
Again, this is the default behavior for a
route.

51
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,500
To use a controller and template with the
same name as the route.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,930
But I wanna make sure you can see in code
exactly what's happening when you

53
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,330
visit a URL.

54
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,070
As I mentioned before, Ember has a heavy
emphasis on convention over configuration.

55
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,360
Ember chooses smart defaults for you, like
using templates and

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,420
controllers with the same names as your
routes.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,300
And if you follow its conventions it will
do a lot of work without requiring you to

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,920
write much code at all.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,785
Now, let's add a model to this route.

60
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:17,139
[NOISE] Here our model simply returns

61
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:26,707
the posts array we created in our sample
data.

62
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:28,896
By setting that array as the model for

63
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:32,720
this route it's now available in the
controller and template.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,528
Lets use the model in the template.

65
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:44,528
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:50,689
The each helper loops over each element of
the model,

67
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,690
which in this case is the array of posts.

68
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,890
For each post it repeats the content
inside the helper.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,780
Inside the helper the context gets changed
so that attributes like title are called

70
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,780
on the current post inside of the each
rather than on the controller itself.

71
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,224
Now, let's take a look at our work in the
browser.

72
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:19,624
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:20,250
There we go.

74
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,480
There are our post titles.

75
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,140
You might have noticed that even though we
set controller name

76
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,850
to posts in our route we never actually
made a posts controller.

77
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,410
If you don't create a controller of your
own Ember implicitly creates one for

78
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,430
you, and you might remember from way back
in the beginning of this course I told you

79
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,660
that a controller acts as a proxy between
a model and a template.

80
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,300
The implicit controller is set up to do
that proxying for you, automatically.

81
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,810
Templates never talk directly to models,
they always go through the controller.

82
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,900
Before we do another example,

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,690
let's take out the explicit setting of the
controller and template out of the route.

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
And if we go back here and refresh.

85
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,930
Sure enough, it works just as before.

86
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,650
Usually you won't need to override the
default choice of

87
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,930
controller in template for a route.

88
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,291
But if you do, now you know how.

89
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,040
Let's run through another example of using
an array as a model.

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,700
We'll make a recent comments route to show
recent comments on the site.

91
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,831
First, we'll add an entry to the router.

92
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:37,427
[BLANK_AUDIO]

93
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,252
Next we'll make a route.

94
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:43,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

95
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,535
And we'll add a script tag to our
index.html.

96
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,544
[BLANK_AUDIO]

97
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:50,853
In the route.

98
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:51,977
We'll define it.

99
00:06:51,977 --> 00:07:01,364
[BLANK_AUDIO]

100
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:03,390
Here we'll choose our model.

101
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,770
Let's simply return comments.

102
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,490
Which, if we go back to our store.

103
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,240
There's our array of comments.

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,542
Let's update our application template to
include a link to our recent comments.

105
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:29,733
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,934
And finally, we'll create our template.

107
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:36,727
[BLANK_AUDIO]

108
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:42,199
Before we forget, let's add it to our
handlebar's template loader.

109
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:50,299
[BLANK_AUDIO]

110
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,281
And in the template, we'll display the
recent comments.

111
00:07:53,281 --> 00:08:00,426
[BLANK_AUDIO]

112
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:04,730
We'll display the text property of those
comments.

113
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,106
Let's check it out in the browser now.

114
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:15,952
[SOUND]
And there they are.
