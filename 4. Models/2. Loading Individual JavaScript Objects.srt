00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,690
We've got a nice list of blog posts on our
home page now, but

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,930
we need a way to view an individual post.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,140
In our data, in store.js, we give each
object a unique id.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,030
A common practice is to put that id in the
URL to specify which post we want.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,680
For example adding posts/3 to retrieve a
post with the id of 3.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,530
Ember calls that 3 at the end,

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,860
a dynamic segment because it changes
depending on which post you wanna view.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,905
Let's write a router entry for a route
with a dynamic segment.

9
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:43,835
[SOUND] We'll name the resource post,

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:52,927
for viewing a single post then we'll
customize the path.

11
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:57,350
But I'll start with posts, just like we
said we we're going to do here.

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,410
And then for the ID part put this colon,
write post_id.

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,160
Since this route is called post we know
that it

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,090
will automatically load the post template
and post controller.

15
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,880
We just need to make it load the post with
the given id to use as the model.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,380
Let's make a route file called post.js.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,200
Add a script tag.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,790
And then create the route

19
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,340
and load a model.

20
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,650
And here we can include a parameter called
params.

21
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,830
What we can do is we can say return, grab
that array of posts.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,460
We'll run the find by method.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,030
And the fine by method, actually isn't a
standard JavaScript array method.

24
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,060
Member adds several methods to arrays, and
this is one of them.

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,900
And what we'll do is pass in id, so

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,380
that will look at the id property of all
of the elements in the post array.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,325
And what it will look for is one that
matches params.post_id.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,190
So here we have something new, the params
parameter in the model hook.

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,420
In our router, we added colon post id to
the end of the mapping for the post route.

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,200
That post id bit creates a property on

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,941
params called post_id whose value is the
number in the URL.

32
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,463
Here, for /post/3,

33
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:44,960
params.post_id will turn three, so the
model

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,480
will return the object in the post's array
whose id property's value is three.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,690
In this case, or more generally, whatever
the number is in the URL right here.

36
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,981
Now that we've loaded the model,

37
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:08,697
let's add a post template, add it to our
template loader.

38
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:12,295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:17,939
And in here, we'll write the title and

40
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,230
then the body of the post.

41
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,200
Let's also add links to each post from the
homepage.

42
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,300
We'll link to the post route, but

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,500
how do we know which post to link to since
there's a dynamic segment?

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,190
Well we can add a second argument to the
link two helper.

45
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,810
We can say this.id.

46
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,000
This refers to whatever post we're
currently looking at in the each loop.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,580
And then we're just accessing the id
property.

48
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,777
So now it'll link to the post route with
this.id as the dynamic segment.

49
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,007
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,140
Now, let's check our page in the browser.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,140
We've got our links.

52
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,290
When we click them, we're going to the
right url.

53
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,710
But nothing's showing up on the page.

54
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,800
Let's see what we, if we can figure out
what we did wrong.

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,770
Oh, here we go.

56
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:28,860
We called this post.js instead of
post.hbs, let's rename this.

57
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,970
We'll refresh the page.

58
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
And there we go.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,124
Now it works.
