00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,385
While you're working on individual posts,
let's add the ability to edit them.

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:12,536
[NOISE] So put conditional.

3
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:14,729
They aren't editing.

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:19,271
Then we'll show the actual body.

5
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:26,315
We'll add a button [SOUND] with an action

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:32,508
that will trigger editing [SOUND].

7
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,977
So if they are editing, we'll have a form
for the editing.

8
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:44,270
[SOUND] Using our bootstrap class here for
form groups.

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:51,635
[SOUND] Standard label tag.

10
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,931
Here's where it gets interesting.

11
00:00:52,931 --> 00:01:01,474
[SOUND] Just like a normal input tag we
have an id set equal to title.

12
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:02,720
Can add a class.

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,700
Now we say value equals title.

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,090
I'll explain exactly what this does in
just a moment.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,329
So we can edit the title there.

16
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,825
Let's make it so we can also edit the
body.

17
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:27,825
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:44,890
Okay.

19
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,420
So here we've got this form and in general
it looks like standard HTML, but

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,020
the input tags are replaced with
Handlebar's input helper.

21
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,040
And in this case, the text area tag is
replaced with the text area helper.

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,030
Here inside the input helper, the value is
set equal to title.

23
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,900
And here, the value is set equal to body.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Notice these aren't in quotes.

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,520
By using the input helper, the data will
be bound to these properties.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,150
In other words, when you update this
property in the template.

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,590
The property will automatically change on
the controller,

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,410
which will propagate it to the model.

29
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,620
If that's a little confusing, don't worry.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,800
It'll make more sense when you see it in
action.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,687
For now, let's add the Edit and Save
actions to our controller.

32
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:35,602
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:38,100
We'll need to include it in our
index.html.

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:48,100
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,930
Notice this is a little different.

36
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,620
Instead of saying Ember.Controller.extend,
I've said Ember.ObjectController.extend.

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,840
We'll talk about that in a moment.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,830
So here, we've got the isEditing property,
we'll set it to false to begin.

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:15,830
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,570
So, all that our edit action does is just
set isEditing to true.

41
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,370
And all that our save action does, is set
isEditing to false.

42
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,330
Pretty simple.

43
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,010
If you're having a little bit of trouble
following the flow, that's okay.

44
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,225
Let's take a look at how this looks in the
browser now.

45
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:44,296
[SOUND] Choose a post.

46
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,620
Now we've got our edit button.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,920
We can click edit, and then here's where
the magic happens.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,040
If we change the title here, it changes up
here.

49
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Remember that I said the input handle bars
helper bound the data to the property.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,400
This is what I'm talking about.

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,720
When we change the data in one place it
automatically propagates throughout our

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,110
entire App.

53
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,290
And that's why the save button simply
toggles the isEditing controller property

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,460
to false.

55
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,250
The model object is updated as we type on
the page.

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,270
Let's go back and just take one last look
at that code, again.

57
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,540
So here, the input handlebars helper has a
value set equal to title.

58
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,130
That title property gets set on the
controller which propagates it

59
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,710
through to the model.

60
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,130
So when we change the value of the title
here it immediately gets changed on

61
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,850
the model, and since this reads the
property from the controller which

62
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,940
proxies it to the model, this gets updated
as we type.

63
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,320
Note that when we write a controller to
represent a model whose value is

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,434
a single object.

65
00:04:53,434 --> 00:05:00,320
We use Ember.ObjectController.extend
instead of Ember.Controller.

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,050
Remember a template only communicates with
its controller.

67
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,970
And then the controller can communicate
with the model.

68
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,280
When the templates gets or sets a property
on an object controller,

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,060
it will pass that request to the model, if
the model has that property.

70
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,690
If you just use Ember.Controller,

71
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,800
the controller won't proxy information
between the model and the template.

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,190
You can try it out in our code to c.

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,280
If we change Ember.ObjectController to
just Ember.Controller.

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,190
Let's refresh here.

75
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,360
Now there's nothing on the page.

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,130
That's because here the title property is
being read from the controller.

77
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,790
But since the title property isn't set on
the controller, and the controller is no

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:52,410
longer proxying an object to use as the
model then the value of title is empty.

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's change it back, so that our app
works properly now.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,190
Similarly, we can make a controller for

81
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,020
our post's route using
Ember.ArrayController.

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,430
Let's end the ability to sort our posts by
their title.

83
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:20,808
[NOISE] In our posts template,

84
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:27,313
we'll add a link, with

85
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:34,805
an action to sort by title.

86
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:39,288
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,852
And then in our controller, we'll define
that action.

88
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:52,852
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,750
Here, when we set the sort properties,
property, on an array controller.

90
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,030
Ember will sort the array by the
properties you list.

91
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,959
If you wanna have them sorted by default,
you can set the property by default.

92
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:17,228
[BLANK_AUDIO]

93
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,853
You can also include multiple properties
if you want to sort by multiple values,

94
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:25,690
such as if we had a date and time
properties on our posts.

95
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,530
You can also include multiple properties
if you wanna sort by

96
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,238
multiple values such as if we had date or
time properties on our posts.

97
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:43,208
[SOUND] For now let's just take a look at
how that sort by title action works.

98
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,662
Well, while the posts are all ready
sorted.

99
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:50,742
Let's change their order inner store.js
file.

100
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:59,438
[BLANK_AUDIO]

101
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,980
Okay.

102
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,950
Now if we click sort by title there we go.
