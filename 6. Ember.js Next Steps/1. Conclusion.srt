00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,642
[SOUND] Congratulations on getting through
this Ember JS course.

2
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:13,370
Ember's an amazing framework for building
web application user interfaces.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,280
And by this time,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,037
I hope you're comfortable with the basics
of building Ember apps.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,250
The next step I'd suggest you'd take is to
go through the Ember guides.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,410
The opening video on the guides, where
you'll build another blogging app and

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,120
the getting started walk through of how to
build a to do list will reinforce much of

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,080
what you've learned in these lessons,

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,210
as well as introduce you to some powerful
new tools.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,190
Like computed properties.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,700
Attribute binding in views.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,550
I think you'll really enjoy learning about
them.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,500
When you want to build a real Ember app,
where you care about things like

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,880
performance and deployment, you should
look into Ember CLI.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,410
Ember CLI is a command line utility that
includes a server, build tools,

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,310
dependency management, and much more.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,765
It has a bit of a steep learning curve,
but

18
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,850
it's the best way to build production grid
Ember apps.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,790
Finally, one of the most frustrating parts
of Ember is when something goes wrong.

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,240
Often, the error messages are cryptic and
they don't always give you file names or

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,810
line numbers.

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,200
Searching online is often your best bet.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,930
But ignore anything written more than a
year ago,

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,640
cuz Ember has changed dramatically since
then,

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,990
especially before its 1.0 version was
released on August 31st 2014.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,500
For Ember data issues, don't look at
anything from before 2014.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,280
Major changes were introduced at the end
of 2013.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,260
When you have a question you just can't
find an answer to,

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,100
Stack Overflow is a great place to turn.

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,508
And give back on Stack Overflow by
answering questions for other people.

31
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:56,310
The Ember API documentation is another
fantastic resource.

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,230
Although like most API documentation, it
can be a bit hard to read.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,740
And finally, the Ember forums are a great
place to learn and

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,135
discuss best practices and new features.

35
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:12,400
Ember.js bills itself as a framework for
creating ambitious web applications.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,320
I hope you'll go and build something
ambitious now.
